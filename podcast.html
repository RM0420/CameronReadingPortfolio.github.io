        This year I felt I grew as a reader and a writer in many ways. One of the main ways I grew as a reader is by branching out into different genres. I started out the year 
        reading only fantasies with magic things of the sort. I also read 2 science fiction series, Arc of a Sythe and Unwind. I got a suggestion from my friend to read Throne of 
        Glass, Six of Crows, and A Darker Shade of Magic. These books were darker and grittier than the books I read the year before like Fablehaven and Dragon Watch. These are a 
        welcome change, and I don't see myself going back to those kinds of books. To see how I have grown as a writer, you just have to look at the two memoirs I wrote. The one in 
        7th grade and the one in 8th. My 7th-grade memoir was horrible when compared to my 8th-grade one. I had many conventional mistakes, and my sensory details were lacking. I 
        only had 2 to 3 examples of imagery(and that was only because they were required). I also didn't vary my sentence structure. As a result, I got a really bad grade, if I had 
        lost one more point I wouldn't have been able to get into honors next year. My 8th-grade memouir was much better comparatively. There was much more polish and work done on 
        this. I spent a lot of time proofreading so there are barely any conventional errors through the passage. I feel like this is one of the best writing pieces I have ever done 
        in my life. I had many sensory details. I also had many examples of imagery, this time I didn't do it because it was required, but because it enhanced my writing. I also 
        varied the sentence structures and used way fewer "I"s. On this assignment, I got a decent grade of 96%. I know going into high school these changes to my writing will be 
        very helpful.

        The most challenging part aspect of the class for me was the little prince. I hated that it was left up to interpretation. I prefer things to have a right and a wrong answer. 
        All the questions had no right answer, but I always worried I had the wrong one. I wanted to know whether my interpretation was right, and by that, I guess I wanted the one 
        that was most common. I hope going into high school I can be better at this.
        <br>
        <br>
        The most enjoyable part of the class was definitely the debates. Whether it was on if money could buy happiness or what would you do if you were the pilot in the little 
        prince, the debates were always interesting and fun. It always gave you something to talk about and discuss in specials right after as I was with a lot of the kids from my 
        class. And btw Mrs. Cameron, Money can buy happiness.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whether I was reading an amazing book, dying of laughter on the inside, or having a philosophical debate on whether or not you should knock out your friend and save yourself, 
        this class was one of if not the best classes of the year. Thank you for listening.
